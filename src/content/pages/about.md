I received my bachelor's of arts in communication from [Coastal Carolina University](https://www.coastal.edu/) in Conway, South Carolina. My concentration was broadcast journalism and my minor was political science. Toward the end of my undergraduate career, I was "bit by the research bug." When I went to ask one of my professors for a letter of recommendation, he asked if I would be interested in coding for a book chapter of his on the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida. I had read Dave Cullen's *Columbine* earlier that summer, and was interested in how media framed the shooting in the news. I coded for that chapter and during my last semester at Coastal Carolina, I took that professor's graduate media effects seminar, where we collaborated on a framing analysis of the Parkland shootings. This paper got published in *Journalism Practice,* my first publication. 

I am currently a master's student at Virginia Tech's School of Communication. I am currently working on my thesis examining press releases from Everytown for Gun Safety, the NRA, President Trump, and Vice President Biden's campaigns, exploring who builds what agenda. In addition to my thesis, I am conducting political public relations and media effects research. I currently have a paper accepted to the National Communication Association Convention--a longitudinal study of mass shooting news coverage from 1999 to 2019.
